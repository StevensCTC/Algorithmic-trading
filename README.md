# Algorithmic-trading

## What is this
An introduction to algorithmic trading for people new to finances. What this is not: Machine Learning based trading or advising.

## Core idea
In combining programming with trading, I am starting to implement basic financial strategies in Python (ie tracking trends or moving averages). This is meant to be a training exercise. There could be many bugs in this software. You use it at your own risk.
